  1. Download and extract the assignment folder
  2. Assignment folder consist of two sub folders
  
     api - Express application
     
     app - Vuejs frontend application
     
  3. Go inside the "api" folder and run the `npm install` in command prompt or terminal.
  4. Once npm command run completely then run `node index.js`

  I used CDN javascript package for Vuejs application development so the application requires Active internet cocnnection and latest node version.
